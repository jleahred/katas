== Input

=== Grammar


==== Rule elements enumeration

Examples below

[horizontal]
`=`:: On left, symbol, on right expresion defining symbol
`symbol`:: On right, it's an string without quotes
`.`:: Any char
`"..."`:: Literal delimited by quotes
`space`:: Separate tokens and Rule concatenation (and operation)
`/`:: Or operation
`(...)`:: A expression composed of sub expresions
`?`:: One optional
`*`:: Repeat 0 or more
`+`:: Repeat 1 or more
`!`:: negate expression
`[...]`:: Match chars. It's a list or ranges (or both)
`->`:: pending...
`:`:: pending...

Let's see by example

A simple literal string.

.Literal
[source, peg]
----
main = "Hello world"
----

.Concatenation (and)
[source, peg]
----
main = "Hello "  "world"
----


Referencing symbols

.Symbol
[source, peg]
----
main = hi
hi   = "Hello world"
----

Or conditions `/`

.Or
[source, peg]
----
main = "hello" / "hi"
----

.Or multiline
[source, peg]
----
main
    = "hello"
    / "hi"
    / "hola"
----

.Or multiline 2
[source, peg]
----
main = "hello"
     / "hi"
     / "hola"
----


.Or disorganized
[source, peg]
----
main = "hello"
     / "hi" / "hola"
----


.Parenthesis
[source, peg]
----
main = ("hello" / "hi")  " world"
----


Just multiline

.Multiline1
[source, peg]
----
main
    = ("hello" / "hi")  " world"
----

.Multiline2
[source, peg]
----
main
    = ("hello" / "hi")
    " world"
----

.Multiline3
[source, peg]
----
main = ("hello" / "hi")
     " world"
----


It is recomended to use or operator `/` on each new line and `=` on first line, like


.Multiline organized
[source, peg]
----
main = ("hello" / "hi")  " world"
     / "bye"
----

.One optional
[source, peg]
----
main = ("hello" / "hi")  " world"?
----


.Repetitions
[source, peg]
----
main         = one_or_more_a / zero_or_many_b
one_or_more  = "a"+
zero_or_many = "b"*
----

Negation will not move current possition

Next example will consume all chars till get an "a"

.Negation
[source, peg]
----
main = (!"a" .)* "a"
----

.Consume till
[source, peg]
----
comment = "//" (!"\n" .)*
        / "/*" (!"*/" .)* "*/"
----

Match a set of chars.
Chars can be defined by range.


.Match chars
[source, peg]
----
number  = digit+ ("." digit+)?
digit   = [0-9]
a_or_b  = [ab]
id      = [_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9]*

a_or_b_or_digit  = [ab0-9]
----


Simple recursion

.one or more "a" recursive
[source, peg]
----
as  = "a" as
    / "a"

//  simplified with `+`
ak = "a"+
----



Recursion to match parenthesis

.Recursion match par
[source, peg]
----
match_par = "(" match_par ")"
          / "(" ")"
----




Grammar pending...


=== Text

Hey, I'm a text parser, I need a text to parse ;-P

If you want to parse text indentation sensitive, I recomend you the lib
https://github.com/jleahred/indentation_flattener[indentation_flattener]

The only consideration about the text to parse, is the type. It's not a generic String, it has to be
a more concrete `Text2Parse`

[source, rust]
----
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Default)]
pub struct Text2Parse(pub String);
----



== Output

=== AST

Well, you can see code on... let say `ast.rs` (not surprising)

[source, rust]
----
#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct Node {
    pub kind: K,
    pub val: V,
    pub nodes: Box<Vec<Node>>,
}
----

An ast, is a `root` node, witch have subnodes and recursivily, we got a tree.

Next are the kind types of a node.

[source, rust]
----
pub enum K {
    Root,
    EAnd,
    ENot,
    ERepeat,
    ALit,
    AMatch,
    ADot,
    ASymbref,
    AEof,
}
----

The ones who start with `Exxx` are `Expressions` nodes. Starting with `Axxxx` we have the atom
nodes.

With method `get_pruned` we can remove non interesting nodes.




== API

It works with concrete types vs general types (reducing use of types like String, u32 or usize)

== Hacking the code

The grammar is a set of rules

[source, rust]
----
type Rules = HashMap<Symbol, Expression>;
----

A Symbol is just a String
[source, rust]
----
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Default, Clone)]
pub struct Symbol(pub String);
----


An expression can be one of...

[source, rust]
----
#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum Expression {
    Simple(Atom),
    Or(MultiExpr),
    And(MultiExpr),
    Not(Box<Expression>),
    Repeat(Box<Expression>, NRep, Option<NRep>), //  min max
}
----

An atom can be just...

[source, rust]
----
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
pub enum Atom {
    Literal(String),
    Match(String, Vec<(char, char)>),
    Dot,
    Symbol(String),
    Nothing,
}
----


[source, rust]

=== A grammar for the grammar

A grammar to define the grammar to be parsed by de parser. ;-P

I will define the grammar using the this parser grammar definition rules.


[source, peg]
----
grammar = rule+

rule    = symbol  _  "="  _>   expr  _EI?

_   = " "*
----

Here we relax the verification to keep the grammar as simple as possible.

A grammar is a set of rules, where a rule is the symbol name followed by an expression.

About the expression.

As you know, it's important to accept valid inputs, but also it's important to
build an AST with proper pritority.

Next grammar:

[source, peg]
----
main    =  "A" "B"  /  "B" "C"
----

It's equivalent to:

[source, peg]
----
main    =  ("A" "B")  /  ("B" "C")
----


And not to:

[source, peg]
----
main    =  (("A" "B")  /  "B") "C"
----

To represent this priority, the expression rule has to be defined in a descendant
priority way:


[source, peg]
----
expr            =   or_expr

or_expr         =   and_expr     ("/"  or_expr)*

and_expr        =   compl_expr   (" "  and_expr)*

compl_expr      =   "!" simpl_par
                /   simpl_par ("*" / "+")

simpl_par       =   (simple / parenth_expr)


parenth_expr    =   "("  expr ")"
simple          =   atom
----

Descendant definition

[horizontal]
simpl_par::     It's an atom or a parenthesis experssion

compl_expr::    Complete expresssion. It's a full subtree expression +
                It can have negation or (zero or more or one or more)

and_expr::      Sequence of expressions separated by space

or_expr::       Sequence of expression separated by "/"


Now, it's the `atom` turn:

[source, peg]
----
atom    =   literal
        /   match
        /   dot
        /   symbol

literal =   "\""  (!"\"" .)*  "\""
match   =   "["  ((.  "-"  .)  /  (.))+   "]"
dot     =   "."
symbol  =   [a-zA-Z0-9_]+
----


Hey, what about comments?

What about non significative spaces and carry return?

It will be defined on "_" symbol


[source, peg]
----
grammar         =   rule+

rule            =   symbol  _  "="  _   expr  (_eol / eof)  _

expr            =   or_expr

or_expr         =   and_expr    (_ "/"  _  or_expr)*

and_expr        =   compl_expr  (  " "  _  and_expr)*

compl_expr      =   simpl_par ("*" / "+")?
                /   "!" simpl_par

simpl_par       =   (simple / parenth_expr)


parenth_expr    =   "("  _  expr  _  ")"
simple          =   atom



atom    =   literal
        /   match
        /   dot
        /   symbol

literal =   "\u{34}"  (!"\u{34}" .)*  "\u{34}"
match   =   "["  ( (.  "-"  .)  /  (!"]") )+   "]"
dot     =   "."
symbol  =   [a-zA-Z0-9_]+


_   =  (" "
    /   "\n"
    /   comment)*

_eol = " "*  "\n"
     / comment

comment =  "//" (!"/n" .)* "/n"
        /  "/*" (!"*/" .)* "*/"
----

That's ok an works fine, but we can inprove error messages...

In order to improve error messages, would be interesting to modify the grammar.

Look this code:

[source, rust]
----
    let parsed = parse(&text2parse(r#"h= asdf (hi"#),
                       &symbol("grammar"),
                       &grammar());

    match parsed {
        Err(err) => println!("error... {} ___________", err),
        Ok(res) => println!("Ok... {:?} ___________", res),
    };
----

At the beggining it finished with no errors, but not consuming the hole input.
Wich is an error.

Showing an error informing that we didn't consume full input, is not the best.

[source]
----
error... in pos: r:1, c:9, n:8   >h= asdf <  -> unexpected >(hi<
----

The reason is on

[source, peg]
----
...
and_expr        =   compl_expr  (  " "  _  and_expr)*
...
----

Here, we said, "hey, try to look for a sequence, or not `*`"

And is not, then the parser say, I matched the rule, I have to continue verifying other
previus branches. But there are no previus partial applied brunchs.
Then the parser ends not consuming all the input.

To improve this message, I added deep_error on Status for these situations

[source, rust]
----
pub struct Status {
    pub pos: Possition,
    pub depth: Depth,
    pub deep_error: Option<Error>,
}
----

Now the new error message in these circunstances will be:

[source]
----
error... in pos: r:1, c:7, n:6   >h=a (b<  -> s.and_expr > s.compl_expr > s.simpl_par > s.parenth_expr > lit. expected ")", got ""
----

Much better!!!

In any case, to improve error messages, would be interesting to have something like:

[source, peg]
----
parenth_expr    =   "("  _  expr  _  ")"
                /   "("  _  expr  _      -> error("mismatch parenthesis")
----

The or brunch will execute if there is no closing parenthesis and we can
write an specific error message.

This is annotated on todo: for future revisions
